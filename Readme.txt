1. Briefly describe the conceptual approach you chose! What are the trade-offs?
A: I mainly focused on the input file provided by the user in json format and as per the data provided the user the define their own rules to get the voilated signals and save the same in text file at application path. As per my understanding I tried my best not to create any tradeoffs for this application.
2. What's the runtime performance? What is the complexity? Where are the bottlenecks?
A: Memory Usage: 25-26 KB, Time taken to complete task including user defined rule (default file): 30 Secs.
For me, the major bottleneck for this app was: Unable to test the same on multiple OS becuase I have only Windows system (Checked on Windows only), so not able to provide the performance measure on the other OSs.
Not aware how to calculate Complexity of application, never worked on the same or never be the part of that team.
3. If you had more time, what improvements would you make, and in what order of priority?
A: If I had more time then I would have worked on given below points to improve:
a. Make app Less time consumption than current time consumption or would have refactored my code in more better way to make it run more faster.
b. Better option for user to define rules as per signal's value type
c. Would have given the option to save output in multi-file format or database
d. Would have tested the application with hugh no. of data to make it more efficient.
